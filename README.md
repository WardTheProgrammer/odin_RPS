## Rock Paper Scissors

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game against the computer, with the winner being the first person to reach 5 points. Press one of the 3 top buttons to start the game by choosing you pick. After this, you press the button of your click for each round. Press the restart button the play the game again.
This project is coded in HTML, CSS and JS.
I would like to add better icons for the top buttons in the future.

You can run the website by using the html previewer of GitHub or by going to my portfolio, which is on my GitHub, and clicking on the link there.

This project was done following _[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home)_
